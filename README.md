# makecode-cpx-docker

A Docker config for makecode.adafruit.com for Circuit Playground Express

This is a locally-hosted version of the makecode web programming tool for the Circuit Playground Express. 

In theory, I will be able to conduct a CPX workshop in a location with no internet, by running this docker container from my laptop and having participants browse to `http://MYIPADDRESS:3232`
